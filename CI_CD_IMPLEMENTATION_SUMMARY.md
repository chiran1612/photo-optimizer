```
1. Compile application with Maven
2. Package into JAR file
3. Upload build artifacts for storage
```

#### **Stage 3: Security Scanning**
```
1. Run Trivy vulnerability scanner
2. Scan file system for security issues
3. Upload security reports to GitHub
```

#### **Stage 4: Docker Build**
```
1. Set up Docker Buildx for advanced builds
2. Login to GitHub Container Registry
3. Extract metadata for image tagging
4. Build Docker image with caching
5. Push image to registry with multiple tags
```

#### **Stage 5: Deployment**
```
1. Deploy to staging (develop branch only)
2. Deploy to production (main branch only)
3. Run smoke tests after deployment
```
